# BDD Testing

This program uses Specflow, Selenium and NUnit to test a Golfing Union of Ireland Booking system

Our first test will check that wehave navigated to the GolfingUnion site
The second test will validate that we have entered an approved Username + Password
The third and forth test will check that the user has successfully booked and has received a confirmation and
validating that the Bookings-Made for that timesheet has been entered
